# Legacy_ISRU
Part mod for KSP2 that adds the Ore resource, Ore drills, Ore tanks and Ore convertors.

This mod aims to reintroduce basic ISRU into the game in a way similar to its implementation in KSP1. 
The core gemplay loop revolves around a new resource, Ore. Ore represents a mix of useful material collected from Celestial Bodies that can be turned into useful resources like Methane, Oxygen and Monoproppelant.
Ore can be collected on any Celestial Body when the vessel is Landed.
to collect Ore, player will need to have a Resource Drill part on their vessel. They will also need to have atleast one Ore tank to collect the mined Ore.
Collected Ore can be converted into either Methane, Oxygen, Methalox or Monoproppelant using the Convertatron part.
The Resource Drill and Convertatron parts require EC (electric charge) to work.
